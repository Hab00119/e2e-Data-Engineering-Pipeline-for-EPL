# Football Data Engineering Pipeline Project
I'll design a comprehensive end-to-end data engineering project for football data from understat.com that incorporates modern data engineering practices and tools. This pipeline will handle matches, clubs, players, leagues, and seasons with automatic updates for new data.

## Architecture Overview
Let's structure this as a modular pipeline with the following components:

- Data Scraping Layer - Extract data from understat.com
- Data Streaming Layer - Real-time data handling
- Data Processing Layer - Transform and process the data
- Data Storage Layer - Store processed data (with Postgres or GCP options)
- Orchestration Layer - Manage workflow and pipeline
- Visualization Layer - Display insights
- Infrastructure Layer - Containerization and deployment

### Detailed Component Breakdown
1. Data Scraping Layer

Python Scrapy - For efficient web scraping with built-in concurrency
Selenium - For dynamic content that requires JavaScript rendering
BeautifulSoup - For HTML parsing
Proxies & Rate Limiting - To avoid IP bans

2. Data Streaming Layer

Kafka/Redpanda - For real-time data streaming
Kafka Connect - For source/sink connectors
Schema Registry - To maintain data schemas and versioning

3. Data Processing Layer

PySpark - For batch processing of historical data
PyFlink - For real-time processing of streaming data
Pandas - For lighter transformations
dbt - For data transformation and modeling

4. Data Storage Layer

Option A: PostgreSQL

TimescaleDB extension for time-series data
PostGIS for geographical data


Option B: GCP

BigQuery for analytical queries
Cloud Storage for raw data lake
Firestore for specific low-latency queries



5. Orchestration Layer

Airflow - For batch pipeline orchestration
Kestra - For event-driven workflows
Great Expectations - For data quality and validation

6. Visualization Layer

Streamlit - For interactive dashboards
Power BI - For business intelligence reporting
Grafana - For real-time metrics and monitoring

7. Infrastructure Layer

Docker & Docker Compose - For containerization
Makefile - For build automation
GitHub Actions - For CI/CD pipelines
Terraform - For infrastructure as code
Poetry - For Python dependency management
Kubernetes - For container orchestration (optional for scaling)

### Data Models
We'll structure our data models to cover:

Leagues - Information about football leagues
Seasons - Seasonal data for each league
Teams - Club information and season performance
Players - Player profiles and statistics
Matches - Match details and outcomes
Events - In-match events (goals, cards, etc.)
Statistics - Advanced metrics like xG, possession, etc.

## Pipeline Flow

### Ingestion Phase

Scrape data from understat.com on a scheduled basis
Stream new match data in near real-time when available
Store raw data in storage (object storage or staging tables)


### Processing Phase

Transform raw data into structured formats
Apply business logic and calculations
Handle data quality checks and validations


### Loading Phase

Load processed data into the chosen data store
Update existing records or append new ones
Maintain data lineage and versioning


### Visualization Phase

Expose processed data via APIs
Generate dashboards and reports
Allow for interactive data exploration



### Key Features

Parameterization - All components accept parameters (leagues, seasons, update frequency)
Real-time Updates - Stream processing for new matches and events
Historical Backfilling - Batch processing for historical data
Data Quality - Validation checks throughout the pipeline
Scaling - Ability to scale horizontally for performance
Monitoring - Comprehensive logging and alerting
Documentation - Auto-generated documentation
